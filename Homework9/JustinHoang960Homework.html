   <h2> <u> Origins </u> </h2>

    <p> This dogs name is Rosita, my mom gave her that name. My young sister wanted to own a dog in 2012. One day we decided to go to a pet daycare far away at a mall and find a pet. Out of the options we picked, the family decided to pick up this puppy. It was a girl and is a maltese, we decided on her simply because she doesn't shed fur as much and would be easier to clean. When Rosita was young, she was pretty anxious and aimless around the house. However she was able to adapt to her new home well. Rosita mostly remained at home but on occasion we take her outside to walk around near the coast.</p>

  <h2> <u> Personality </u> </h2>
    <p> Rosita for the most part is an ordinary dog. She was mostly active around the house when she was young play with her toys. A couple of years later Rosita stopped getting attached to her toys and mostly be lazy around the house relaxing on the living room sofa. She does learn some tricks like sitting, hand shaking, and kissing, but only out of the desire to eat some food she enjoys like ham. Rosita has a hierarchy of who she prefers to like out of the family from ignoring to wanting attention from them. She likes to hang around with my dad a lot, along with my mom, then it's me, and last is my sister.  </p>
