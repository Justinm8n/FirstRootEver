  <p> Question: Without using relative or absolute positioning, what is another way to organize elements on a page? </p>

  <section>
    <p> There are other forms of positioning besides the relative and absolute position. There is static positioning, which its position is dictated by the page itself. There's fixed positioning, which remains in the same place on a website regardless if the page is scrolled or not. And then there's sticky positioning, which is a combination of both relative and fixed positioning. </p>

  <section>
    <p> There isn't any reason as to the colors, images, layout, or other choices for my website. I just came up with the designs on my head and try my best to reflect that on my website. </p>
